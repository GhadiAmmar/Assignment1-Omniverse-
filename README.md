This program creates a basic assembly of a robotic arm having seperate components and assembeled together
Components: 
base: The base rotator of the robotic arm which is a cylinder having a radius of 1 and height of 0.5 (short and wide and center 0.25 on y so it is exactly on the ground)
lower_arm: which is a cube shaped component with the scale of 3 on the y-axis (long arm centered at 2 on y-axis 0.5 of base + 1.5 of half of arm)
upper_arm: a cube shaped component of scale 3 on y-axis (same as lower arm centered at 5)
Gripper: a sphere of radius 0.5 (centered at 6.5)
